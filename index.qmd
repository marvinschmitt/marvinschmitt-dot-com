- **June 21, 2023**: I will be at the [ELLIS Doctoral Symposium 2023](https://ellis.eu/events/ellis-doctoral-symposium-2023) in Helsinki from August 28 to September 1, 2023. Absolutely thrilled to meet other PhD students and researchers and talk about machine learning research in beautiful Helsinki!

- **May 9, 2023**: Our paper "JANA: Jointly Amortized Neural Approximation of Complex Bayesian Models" has been accepted to UAI 2023 (Uncertainty in AI). Check out the [project page](projects/#jana-jointly-amortized-neural-approximation-of-complex-bayesian-models) to find out more!

- **May 1, 2023**: Our paper "Association between vitamin D status and eryptosisâ€“results from the German National Cohort Study" has been published in *Annals of Hematology*. A great collaboration among twelve researchers from [Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg](https://www.uni-halle.de/), [Cluster of Excellence SimTech (University of Stuttgart)](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) and [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en). Here's a [link to the paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00277-023-05239-w).

- **April 12, 2023**: I have recorded a 15min presentation about our paper on *Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison* (AISTATS 2023). Check it out: {{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/WIigoUaqy9c 
    title="Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison (AISTATS 2023)"
    aspect-ratio="16x9" >}}

- **March 29, 2023**: I'll be presenting our paper on *Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison* at AISTATS 2023 from April 25-27 in Valencia, Spain. You find links to the paper and code on my <a href="projects/index.qmd#meta-uncertainty-BMC" target="_blank" style="color: #E6AA04;">Projects</a> page or on the dedicated <a href="https://meta-uncertainty.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #E6AA04;">paper website</a>. If you see me around at AISTATS, let's chat!

- **March 20, 2023**: We are hiring a student assistant to help with software development for probabilistic machine learning. 5-10h/week and the student can be based at any German university. <a href="student_assistant_software_engineering_ml/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #E6AA04;">Here</a> is a link to the advertisement. <a href="mailto:mail.marvinschmitt@gmail.com?subject=Student assistant ML software engineering" target="_blank" style="color: #E6AA04;">Drop me a mail</a> if you're interested!

- **March 10, 2023**: Heading to [BayesComp 2023](https://bayescomp2023.com/) in Levi, Finland. Finally putting faces to all those names from papers and Twitter. Presenting a [poster](projects/poster_bayescomp_mms.pdf) and an invited lightning talk. See you around!
