<p>For the past years, my homepage was just a placeholder. It served a single purpose: People who enter the domain of my email address in their browser should not look at some weird empty page. So here we go!</p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible projects <a href="https://gohugo.io/"><code>hugo</code></a>, <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> and the seamless integration into <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/"><code>RStudio</code></a>, it was really a matter of 2 hours to set everything up. I am using the <a href="https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite"><code>CleanWhite</code> Theme</a> by Zhao Huabing. Thank you for creating and publishing this beautiful theme.</p>
<p>BTW: The top banner is a stock photo. If I ever produce code that looks anything like this dense mess, please remind me to quit programming forever.</p>
<p>As pretty much every aspiring early career researcher, I am obviously planning to publish valuable, insightful, and thought-provoking blog posts regularly. See you <del>tomorrow</del> <del>next week</del> <del>in a month</del> at some time for the first actual post. Cheers!</p>
