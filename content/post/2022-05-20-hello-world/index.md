For the past years, my homepage was just a placeholder. It served a single purpose: People who enter the domain of my email address in their browser should not look at some weird empty page. So here we go!

Thanks to the incredible projects [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/), [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and the seamless integration into [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/), it was really a matter of 2 hours to set everything up. I am using the [`CleanWhite` Theme](https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite) by Zhao Huabing. Thank you for creating and publishing this beautiful theme.

BTW: The top banner is a stock photo. If I ever produce code that looks anything like this dense mess, please remind me to quit programming forever.

As pretty much every aspiring early career researcher, I am obviously planning to publish valuable, insightful, and thought-provoking blog posts regularly. See you in ~~tomorrow~~ ~~next week~~ ~~in a month~~ at some time for the first actual post. Cheers!
