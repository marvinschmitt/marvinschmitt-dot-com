Welcome to my blog *The Training Loop*. Here's a collection of articles. Currently, there is no real ordering or coherent theme. I'm not very consistent with writing regular blog posts either -- I'm very proud that I made it further than the lonely "Hello World!" post though. If you want to get a notification when I add a new blog post, you can enter your email address at the bottom of the page. It's free and I won't send spam.
