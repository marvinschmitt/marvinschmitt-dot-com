This is a short blog post to share an exciting announcement with you.
This thought has been on my mind for a while, and I finally decided to take the plunge.

## ‚ú® I‚Äôm starting a YouTube channel ‚ú®

The videos on the YouTube channel will fall into three categories:

-   Early career research: tips and advice based on my own experience

-   Technical topics: Data science, machine learning, and deep learning

-   Applied programming: Visualization, reports, websites, and software design in R and Python

## About the channel üß≠

The direction of the channel is not set in stone, and I‚Äôll try to figure things out along the way.
For now, my main goal is to get better at talking to the camera and practice video editing.
If that piques your interest, I would be thrilled if you checked out my channel.
In my first video, I talk about my background and my plans for the channel (i.e., I have none lol)

## Restructuring my website and newsletter üèó

The launch of the YouTube channel will lead to some restructuring work on my website overall.
Setting up the channel made me think about what my vision is for future content.
The blog will follow the same structure as the channel, with posts on early career research, technical ML/DL topics, and applied programming.
I plan to use the `tag` system to make it easier for you to find the content you are interested in.
This whole process may take a while and I appreciate your patience.
For now, the **newsletter** (see bottom of the page) will mainly be used to send notifications about new content.
I would like to focus on a consistent content schedule before I start sending out newsletters with additional content.
So if you want to stay up to date and get occasional updates directly into your inbox, feel free to subscribe below (it's free!).

## What are your thoughts? üß†

You would make my day if you took a minute to engage with my content.
I truly appreciate any kind of feedback (e.g., my voice is too bass-heavy in the video) or comments.
For example, you might want to let me know:

-   What topics should I cover?
-   Do you have positive examples of similar content that you enjoy?
-   What mistakes should I avoid? What annoys you about other creators?
-   What makes a video worth watching for you?
-   How can I add to the existing conversation on early career research and machine learning?

## Get in touch üì¨

Feel free to drop me a message via email ([mail.marvinschmitt@gmail.com](mailto:mail.marvinschmitt@gmail.com)), or reach out on any social media platform.

Thanks for reading, see you!
