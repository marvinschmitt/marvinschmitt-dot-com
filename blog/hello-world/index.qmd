For the past years, my homepage was just a placeholder. It served a single purpose: People who enter the domain of my email address in their browser should not look at some weird empty page. So here we go!

Thanks to the incredible Quarto project it was really a matter of a few hours to set everything up. Thank you!

BTW: The top banner is a stock photo. If I ever produce code that looks anything like this dense mess, please remind me to quit programming forever.

As pretty much every aspiring early career researcher, I am obviously planning to publish valuable, insightful, and thought-provoking blog posts regularly. See you ~~tomorrow~~ ~~next week~~ ~~in a month~~ at some time for the first actual post. Cheers!
